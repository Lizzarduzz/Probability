# If you roll a 6-sided die once, what is the probability of not seeing a 6?
# If you roll a 6-sided die six times, what is the probability of not seeing
# a 6 on any of those rolls?

# Assign the variable 'p_no6' as the probability of not seeing a 6 on a single roll.

# Calculate the probability of not seeing a 6 on six rolls using `p_no6`. Print your result to the console: do not assign it to a variable.
